# Working with C++
We often use loops to go over series of values and perform operations on them. While more advanced R users typically use techniques such as [vectorization](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/programming.html#vectorised-code), or functions such as [`lapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html), using basic `for` loops is often the best thing to use when going over a series of values. Here we practice this by performing operations over a simple list of values.

Here we have the following list of values:
