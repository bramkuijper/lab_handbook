# A typical work cycle when running simulations

By now, you should have a copy of your simulation code somewhere on your hard disk. We will use your UNIX terminal (which is either MSYS2-64 (windows) or the Terminal programme (mac) to go to this directory, by using the `cd` command to move the relevant work directory. If you are unsure how to do this, see the chapter on how to install software.
