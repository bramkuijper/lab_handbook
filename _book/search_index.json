While more advanced R users typically use techniques such as vectorization, or functions such as lapply(), using basic for loops is often the best thing to use when going over a series of values. Here we practice this by performing operations over a simple list of values. 2.1 Printing values Here we have the following list of values: "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
