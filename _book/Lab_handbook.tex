This document gives you an overview of some of the key computing practices used in our lab. Enjoy!

\hypertarget{installing-and-using-software-to-do-your-work}{%
\chapter{Installing and using software to do your work}\label{installing-and-using-software-to-do-your-work}}

To do your research in theoretical or computational biology, you will need to install a bunch of software. I typically try to keep things as free and open access as possible, so that you don't have hassle with license fees. However, this is not always possible (e.g., research projects involving Mathematica or matlab).

Don't install \emph{all} the software listed below - by now, you should have a clear idea what selection of software you need. If not, get in touch asap.

\hypertarget{on-a-mac-install-your-software-using-the-homebrew-package-manager}{%
\section{On a Mac? Install your software using the Homebrew package manager}\label{on-a-mac-install-your-software-using-the-homebrew-package-manager}}

\href{https://brew.sh}{Homebrew} is a small program that allows you to install and update multiple programs on your Mac simultaneously. Indeed, all research software that you will need on your Mac can be installed with homebrew. Using homebrew has the advantage that installation involves a single command, rather than you having to search for the correct version of the software online. Moreover, all installed packages will be updated to their latest versions by using two simple commands: \texttt{brew\ update}, following by \texttt{brew\ upgrade}.

\hypertarget{installing-homebrew}{%
\subsection{Installing homebrew}\label{installing-homebrew}}

To install homebrew, you need to open the Terminal app (see \protect\hyperlink{MacTerminal}{here} about where to find the Terminal app on your Mac). Once the terminal is open, copy the single-line install statement from the \href{https://brew.sh/}{Homebrew website} and paste it into the Terminal app. Then press `Enter'. You will get a bunch of straightforward questions, after which homebrew installs itself.

\hypertarget{installing-your-first-application-using-homebrew}{%
\subsection{Installing your first application using homebrew}\label{installing-your-first-application-using-homebrew}}

After homebrew is installed, you can use it to install other applications. You can search for software available for install through homebrew by using the website \href{https://formulae.brew.sh}{formulae.brew.sh}.

Let us install the {[}Textmate{]} text editor that we might need later. We do so using the \protect\hyperlink{MacTerminal}{Terminal app} app, in which we type

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{brew}\NormalTok{ install }\AttributeTok{{-}{-}cask}\NormalTok{ textmate}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{updating-all-applications-that-have-been-installed-via-homebrew}{%
\subsection{Updating all applications that have been installed via homebrew}\label{updating-all-applications-that-have-been-installed-via-homebrew}}

This is where things get handier than installing all software individually:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{brew}\NormalTok{ update }\KeywordTok{\&\&} \ExtensionTok{brew}\NormalTok{ upgrade}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{rstudio}{%
\section{Rstudio}\label{rstudio}}

Rather than using the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{absolute bare bones version of R}, I'd use \href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{Rstudio} as it provides a full-blown IDE (integrated development environment) with text editor, variable inspector, file browswer and more. You can either use the \href{https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk}{Rstudio server} that is offered by the University of Exeter, or use a locally installed version of Rstudio. Personally, the server-based version of Rstudio is probably the easiest to use, as it already has tons of packages pre-installed. However, if you have no uni access anymore or don't have continuous internet access, a locally installed version of Rstudio is best.

\hypertarget{using-the-web-based-rstudio-server}{%
\subsection{Using the web-based Rstudio server}\label{using-the-web-based-rstudio-server}}

You can simply access this by using your web browser. You can access the Rstudio server here:
\url{https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk}, using your University of Exeter login.

Once logged in, make sure to run the 4.x.x version, rather than a 3.x.x version. You can change versions on the top right of your Rstudio window within in your web browser. By now

\hypertarget{installing-rstudio-on-your-own-computer-on-windows-or-mac}{%
\subsection{Installing Rstudio on your own computer on windows or mac}\label{installing-rstudio-on-your-own-computer-on-windows-or-mac}}

If you have a Windows machine, the best way to install Rstudio is to download the \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{Desktop version}. If you are on a mac, one could use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{brew}\NormalTok{ install }\AttributeTok{{-}{-}cask}\NormalTok{ rstudio}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{installing-python}{%
\section{Installing Python}\label{installing-python}}

You will need to install the Spyder IDE and associated packages. To this end, it is best to install \href{https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual}{Anaconda} which provide the whole python bundle and comes with a package manager.

\hypertarget{section:installcpp}{%
\section{Installing software to develop C++ programs}\label{section:installcpp}}

When working with the programming language C++, we will need to use the following software:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A UNIX Terminal (already installed on a mac, you will need to install on windows - see below)
\item
  A C++ compiler, which in our case will be \texttt{clang} on mac and \texttt{g++} on windows (see below).
\item
  A better-than-normal text editor. When on Windows, install the freely available text editor \href{}{Notepad++}. See the Notepad++ website for installation instructions. When on a mac, install an editor such as textmate (see below).
\item
  A software build environment like make or cmake.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{do-we-really-need-a-unix-terminal}{%
\section{Do we really need a UNIX terminal?}\label{do-we-really-need-a-unix-terminal}}

Yes, you will need a UNIX terminal to access a broad collection of tools, namely the compiler \texttt{g++} o turn your C++ code into an executable programme, the command \texttt{git} to get code from repositories and \texttt{make} or \texttt{cmake} to automate the building of your code.

Sure, it would be possible to do this using Microsoft's Visual Studio. However, we decided to go for a UNIX-based toolchain everywhere, as these allow us to use the same compiler tools as used on the University's Linux \href{https://universityofexeteruk.sharepoint.com/sites/CornwallARC}{computing clusters}. This is important, as chances are that later on in your project you may want to run your simulations on one of these clusters to run a lot more replicate simulations or explore a large number of parameter combinations. If one has been working with Visual Studio, it typically is a massive pain to switch back to the different tools/compilers used on these Linux clusters. Hence, that is why we stick to a UNIX toolchain.

\hypertarget{installing-a-unix-terminal-on-windows}{%
\subsection{Installing a UNIX terminal on Windows}\label{installing-a-unix-terminal-on-windows}}

To get a UNIX terminal running on windows, we will install the \href{https://www.msys2.org/}{MSYS2} environment. See \href{https://recapexeter.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f2acdf3c-224e-49be-8ae3-ad2400f2b3c1\&start=0}{here} for the installation video. There is also \href{https://recapexeter.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=376342e6-5791-4c25-b2e3-ad2400ffe304\&start=0}{another video} that shows you how to subsequently work with the compiler, once installed.

\hypertarget{installing-a-command-line-c-compiler-on-windows.}{%
\subsection{Installing a command-line C++ compiler on windows.}\label{installing-a-command-line-c-compiler-on-windows.}}

Rather than using any C++ compiler like Visual Studio or Code Blocks, we use the compiler \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/}{g++}, as that compiler is the same as used on our computing clusters. To install it, see the instruction video \href{https://recapexeter.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f2acdf3c-224e-49be-8ae3-ad2400f2b3c1\&start=0}{here}.

\hypertarget{MacTerminal}{%
\subsection{Using the Mac OS Terminal app}\label{MacTerminal}}

To use the UNIX toolchain on a mac, you will need to use a UNIX terminal. Luckily this is installed as per default on any mac distribution. You can find the Terminal app in the \texttt{Applications} \textgreater{} \texttt{Utilities} folder on your hard drive. See Apple's support page \href{https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac}{here} for more information on how to open this application.

\hypertarget{installing-g-on-a-mac}{%
\subsection{Installing g++ on a Mac}\label{installing-g-on-a-mac}}

In order to install g++ on a Mac, you need to follow \href{https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/}{quite some instructions}. Sorry no video.

\hypertarget{a-typical-work-cycle-when-running-simulations}{%
\chapter{A typical work cycle when running simulations}\label{a-typical-work-cycle-when-running-simulations}}

Here we illustrate some of the basic steps we take to run simulations and analyze them. Please type along so that you can see what is happening on your own computer.

\hypertarget{start-the-terminal}{%
\section{Start the terminal}\label{start-the-terminal}}

We assume that you are able to start the a UNIX terminal programme, which should be MSYS2-64 (on windows) or the Terminal programme (on mac). If you don't know where to find your UNIX terminal, read section \ref{section:installcpp} and if that still does not work get in touch.

\hypertarget{get-to-your-home-directory}{%
\section{Get to your home directory}\label{get-to-your-home-directory}}

The home directory on a UNIX terminal is contained in the alias \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} and can be accessed by using the \href{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/cd.htm}{\texttt{cd}} command in the following way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ \textasciitilde{}}
\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## /home/anaduarte
\end{verbatim}

where the last line lists the \href{https://phoenixnap.com/kb/pwd-linux}{\texttt{pwd}} command (present working directory) which gives your current location.

\emph{Note} The home directory in MSYS2 is not the same as your Windows home directory! Rather, MSYS2's home directory \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} maps to something like \texttt{C:/MSYS2/home}.

\hypertarget{check-the-contents-of-your-home-directory}{%
\section{Check the contents of your home directory}\label{check-the-contents-of-your-home-directory}}

You can check the contents of your home directory using the \texttt{ls} (list files) command, where we give it some special `flags', which are given by a dash \texttt{-}, followed by some additional single-character modifiers that change the behaviour of the \texttt{ls} command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ls} \AttributeTok{{-}alnh}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we used the flags \texttt{-alnh} to make sure (i) we list hidden files (\texttt{-a}), (ii) we list all files below each other (the long format: \texttt{-l}) rather than dumping all files together on a single line, (iii) we list all files with numeric \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier}{user and group IDs} (\texttt{-n}) and finally (iv) we list all dates and numbers in a human-readable format (\texttt{-h}). If you want to know more about the documentation of the \texttt{ls} command, type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{man}\NormalTok{ ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

which provides you with a manual page (man page) of the \texttt{ls} command. You can close this man page and return to the command line by pressing the \texttt{q} button.

\hypertarget{git-clone-the-source-code-if-you-havent-already-done-so}{%

All research projects in this lab use code repositories on \href{https://github.com/bramkuijper}{github}, which you can clone to your own computer. Working with code on github has several advantages. One is that it is relatively easy to carry through updates in the code without having to e-mail around umpteen versions of the source code. Moreover, once you have your own github account and I give you write access to my code repository, you can then submit your own updates to my github repository, so that we all have the latest version of the code available.

\hypertarget{finding-out-whether-you-previously-cloned-a-code-repository}{%
\subsection{Finding out whether you previously cloned a code repository}\label{finding-out-whether-you-previously-cloned-a-code-repository}}

If you vaguely remember using the \texttt{git\ clone} command before, perhaps you should first inspect the output of the \texttt{ls\ -lanh} command to find out whether this is the case. If you find a directory within your home directory that looks remarkably similar to one of the \href{https://github.com/bramkuijper?tab=repositories}{repositories} you know enough. If you seem to have \texttt{git\ clone}d before, hold your horses for now and skip the next step.

\hypertarget{clone-one-of-the-software-repositories}{%
\subsection{Clone one of the software repositories}\label{clone-one-of-the-software-repositories}}

You can clone any particular repository by doing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ clone https://github.com/bramkuijper/YOUR\_REPOSITORY}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where \texttt{YOUR\_REPOSITORY} is the name of the repository that you should be using from \href{https://github.com/bramkuijper?tab=repositories}{this list}.

Once everything is cloned, \texttt{cd} into the directory and check out what you find!

\hypertarget{update-the-software-repositroy}{%
\subsection{Update the software repositroy}\label{update-the-software-repositroy}}

If you already have \texttt{git\ clone}d a repository, \texttt{cd} to the directory of the repository on your local computer and obtain the most recent version. You do so by typing

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ pull}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you see the following message:

\begin{verbatim}
Already up-to-date.
\end{verbatim}

everything is cool.

\hypertarget{compiling-the-software}{%
\section{Compiling the software}\label{compiling-the-software}}

For a typical simulation, you will find the source code in the \texttt{src} directory

\hypertarget{some-writing-advice}{%
\chapter{Some Writing Advice}\label{some-writing-advice}}

Writing your dissertation or literature review can be a challenge. Here some advice:

\hypertarget{read-about-writing-literature-that-helps-improving-writing-skills}{%
\section{Read about writing: literature that helps improving writing skills}\label{read-about-writing-literature-that-helps-improving-writing-skills}}

We all read books to improve our writing, even when you are a native speaker and think you have seen it all! (hint: you haven't.) Reading about writing techniques is a great way to improve your skills.

If you want to know more about scientific writing, perhaps the short book by \citet{Mack2018} might well be worth trying. This book is freely available online \href{https://spie.org/Publications/Book/2317706?SSO=1}{here}. Another good book on how to write scientific papers is \citet{Gastel2022}.

For a literature review, it can be helpful to read the paper by \citet{Sayer2018}, which is all about how to write review papers.

Next to learning more about the techniques of scientific writing, it might be helpful to improve your general writing skills too. Several good books are available. A first one is \citet{Williams1990} which has later on appeared
with different titles. Other books are \citet{Pinker2014} and \citet{Zinsser2006}. A classic is \citet{Strunk1959}.

Hard copies of most of these books are available at the library or in my office. Of course, you should not be looking around the internet for pdfs of these books!

\hypertarget{example-theory-papers-to-help-you-write-about-theory}{%
\section{Example theory papers to help you write about theory}\label{example-theory-papers-to-help-you-write-about-theory}}

Papers on theory are a bit different than empirical studies. Hence, here a bunch of examples to see how theory papers are typically written: \citep{Fawcett2007},\citep{Trimmer2015},\citep{Kahn2015}.

In a theory paper it is important to explain the parameters that you use and why. In part, such explanations may focus on a comparison to previous theory, as in: ``To compare our model to predictions made by the classical hawk-dove game \citep{MaynardSmith1973}, the cost of losing a fight \(c\) and the value \(v\) of winning a fight are modeled as unidimensional variables with \(c > v\).''. Alternatively, you could refer to the empirical literature, as in: ``In speckled wood butterflies, it is unlikely that \(v>c\), because territories are far too temporary to be of any value.''

\hypertarget{back-up-qualitative-statements}{%
\subsection{Back up qualitative statements}\label{back-up-qualitative-statements}}

Avoid sentences like ``The random matrix method introduced by May 1977 has been highly important in theoretical ecology. Here we use this technique to understand how mutualisms affect ecosystem dynamics''. The first sentence makes a claim about importance, but does not back it up with a statement that indeed testifies of its importance (one may add: ``as this approach has been central to the analysis of ecosystem stability in several later studies {[}citations{]}''). But even then, you could argue that it still tells very little: why not tell us instead what the random matrix method is about and what it does?

\hypertarget{being-overly-verbose}{%
\subsection{Being overly verbose}\label{being-overly-verbose}}

Avoid sentences such as ``Territory productivity can be measured by a variety of
indirect and direct methods (Davies et al 2012). These measures
can be used to calibrate simulation models.'' The mentioning of
``indirect and direct methods'' adds very little here. Why not give at least an
example of an indirect and a direct method? Or perhaps scrap the indirect vs direct and
just focus on `different methods' and then give an example of such a method.
Or if you realize the sentence on different methods adds too little, why not omit it altogether?

\hypertarget{make-sure-each-paragraph-addresses-the-broader-question}{%
\subsection{Make sure each paragraph addresses the broader question}\label{make-sure-each-paragraph-addresses-the-broader-question}}

It is easy to get mired into examples or definition questions that are a bit particularly. Unless you
make explicit why the paragraph contributes to insight about the broader question
asked in your dissertation, consider what you are writing irrelevant.

\hypertarget{clearly-label-figures}{%
\subsection{Clearly label figures}\label{clearly-label-figures}}

If you use a figure with different panels, each panel should have a label, such
as ``A'', ``B'', ``C'', etc. There are no excuses. If your R package does not do that,
edit your figure in a graphics programme, or look at some of the queries about
labeling figure panels in \texttt{ggplot}, for example \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17576381/label-individual-panels-in-a-multi-panel-ggplot2}{here}.

\hypertarget{reference-all-figures}{%
\subsection{Reference all figures}\label{reference-all-figures}}

If you don't refer to a figure in the text, you don't need it. Throw it out.

\hypertarget{explain-terminology-upon-first-use}{%
\subsection{Explain terminology upon first use}\label{explain-terminology-upon-first-use}}

Typically, assume that the audience is someone who knows quite something
but is not necessarily a scientist. For example, a 2nd-year undergraduate. So
any terminology needs to be explained, let alone any abbreviations upon first
mentioning.
