# Some Writing Advice

Writing your dissertation or literature review is a challenge. Here some advice:

## Literature that helps to improve writing skills
We all read books to improve our writing. Perhaps you should do too! There is no lack of books on this topic!

If you want to get started on this, perhaps the short book by @Mack2018 might well be worth trying. This book
is freely available online [here](https://spie.org/Publications/Book/2317706?SSO=1). Another good book on how to write scientific papers is @Gastel2022. 

Instead of focusing chiefly on scientific writing, it might be that you would like to improve your writing at a more general level too. Several good books are available. A first one is @Williams1990 which has later on appeared
with different titles. Other books are @Pinker2014 and @Zinsser2006. 

Hard copies of most of these books are available at the library or in my office. Of course, you should not be looking around for pdfs of these books...

## Example theory papers to help you write about theory
Papers on theory are a bit different than empirical studies. Hence, here a bunch of examplesto see how theory papers are typically written: [@Fawcett2007],[@Trimmer2015],[@Kahn2015].

In a theory paper it is important to explain why you use these parameters you use (and their values). For example, you may explain that similar values were used in previous papers (which ones?) and that you would like to contrast your results to those papers.




## Common examples where writing goes wrong

### Back up qualitative statements
Avoid sentences like "The random matrix method introduced by May 1977 has been highly important in theoretical ecology. Here we use this technique to understand how mutualisms affect ecosystem dynamics". The first sentence makes a claim about importance, but does not back it up with a statement that indeed testifies of its importance (think: "as this approach has been central to the analysis of ecosystem stability in numerous theoretical studies [citations]"). But even then, you could argue that it still tells very little: why not tell us instead what the random matrix method is about and what it does??

### Being overly verbose
Avoid sentences such as "Territory productivity can be measured by a variety of
indirect and direct methods (Davies et al 2012). These measures of productivity
can be used to calibrate simulation models." Clearly, the mentioning of 
"indirect and direct methods" adds very little here. Why not give at least an
example of an indirect and a direct method? Or perhaps scrap the indirect vs direct and
just focus on 'different methods' and then give an example of such a method.
Or if you realize the sentence on different methods adds too little, why not omit it altogether?

### Make sure each paragraph addresses the broader question
It is easy to get mired into examples or definition questions that are a bit particularly. Unless you
make explicit why the paragraph contributes to insight about the broader question
asked in your dissertation, consider what you are writing irrelevant.

### Clearly label figures 
If you use a figure with different panels, each panel should have a label, such
as "A", "B", "C", etc. There are no excuses. If your R package does not do that,
edit your figure in a graphics programme, or look at some of the queries about
labeling figure panels in `ggplot`, for example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17576381/label-individual-panels-in-a-multi-panel-ggplot2).

### Reference all figures
If you don't refer to a figure in the text, you don't need it. Throw it out.

### Explain terminology upon first use
Typically, assume that the audience is someone who knows quite something 
but is not necessarily a scientist. For example, a 2nd-year undergraduate. So
any terminology needs to be explained, let alone any abbreviations upon first
mentioning. 

### Various writing errors:

- It is evolutionar*ily* stable strategy, not evolutionary stable strategy
- Temperature-related perturbations instead of temperature related perturbations
