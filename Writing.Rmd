# Some Writing Tips

Writing your dissertation or literature review is a challenge. Here some advice:

## Don't look down on reading a lot on how to write
We all read books to improve our writing and you should do too. 

If you want to get started on this, perhaps the short book by [@Mack2018] might well be worth trying. This book
is freely available online [here](https://spie.org/Publications/Book/2317706?SSO=1). Another good book on 
writing a scientific paper is [@Gastel2022]. 

If you want to improve your writing style in general, then there are several
good books available. A first one is 'Style: toward [@Williams1990] which has later on appeared
with different titles. 
l [@Pinker2014,@Zinsser2005]. 
If you want to focus on writing scientific papers, 



If you are one of my project students and you show me that these books are not available 
in the library, I can get you money to buy you a book or two on this.

## Avoid being vague
Avoid sentences such as "Territory productivity can be measured by a variety of
indirect and direct methods (Davies et al 2012). Such measures of productivity
can subsequently help us calibrate the simulation model". Clearly the mentioning of 
"indirect and direct methods" adds very little here. Why not give at least an
example of an indirect and a direct method? Or perhaps scrap the indirect vs direct and
just focus on 'different methods' and then give an example of one such method.
Or if you realize the sentence on different methods adds little, why not omit it altogether?

## Clearly label figures 
If you use a figure with different panels, each panel should have a label, such
as "A", "B", "C", etc. There are no excuses. If your R package does not do that,
edit your figure in a graphics programme, or look at some of the queries about
labeling figure panels in `ggplot`, for example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17576381/label-individual-panels-in-a-multi-panel-ggplot2).

## Reference all figures
If you don't refer to a figure in the text, you don't need it. Throw it out.

## Explain terminology
Typically, assume that the audience is someone who knows quite something 
but is not necessarily a scientist. For example, a 2nd-year undergraduate. So
any terminology needs to be explained, let alone any abbreviations upon first
mentioning. 

## Common writing errors

- It is evolutionar*ily* stable strategy, not evolutionary stable strategy
- Temperature-related perturbations instead of temperature related perturbations
