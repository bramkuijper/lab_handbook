# Installing and using software to do your work
To do your research in theoretical or computational biology, you will need to install a bunch of software. I typically try to keep things as free and open access as possible, so that you don't have hassle with license fees. However, this is not always possible (e.g., research projects involving Mathematica or matlab).

Don't install *all* the software listed below - by now, you should have a clear idea what selection of software you need. If not, get in touch asap.

## On a Mac? Install your software using the Homebrew package manager
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh){target="_blank"} is a small program that allows you to install and update multiple programs on your Mac simultaneously. Indeed, all research software that you will need on your Mac can be installed with homebrew. Using homebrew has the advantage that installation involves a single command, rather than you having to search for the correct version of the software online. Moreover, all installed packages will be updated to their latest versions by using two simple commands: `brew update`, following by `brew upgrade`.

### Installing homebrew
To install homebrew, you need to open the Terminal app (see [here](#MacTerminal) about where to find the Terminal app on your Mac). Once the terminal is open, copy the single-line install statement from the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/){target="_blank"} and paste it into the Terminal app. Then press 'Enter'. You will get a bunch of straightforward questions, after which homebrew installs itself.

### Installing your first application using homebrew
After homebrew is installed, you can use it to install other applications. You can search for software available for install through homebrew by using the website [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh). 

Let us install the [Textmate] text editor that we might need later. We do so using the [Terminal app](#MacTerminal) app, in which we type
```{bash eval=F}
brew install --cask textmate
```

### Updating all applications that have been installed via homebrew
This is where things get handier than installing all software individually:
```{bash eval=F}
brew update && brew upgrade
```

## Rstudio
Rather than using the [absolute bare bones version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}, I'd use [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as it provides a full-blown IDE (integrated development environment) with text editor, variable inspector, file browswer and more. You can either use the [Rstudio server](https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk){target="_blank"} that is offered by the University of Exeter, or use a locally installed version of Rstudio. Personally, the server-based version of Rstudio is probably the easiest to use, as it already has tons of packages pre-installed. However, if you have no uni access anymore or don't have continuous internet access, a locally installed version of Rstudio is best.

### Using the web-based Rstudio server
You can simply access this by using your web browser. You can access the Rstudio server here:
[https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk](https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk){target="_blank"}, using your University of Exeter login. 

Once logged in, make sure to run the 4.x.x version, rather than a 3.x.x version. You can change versions on the top right of your Rstudio window within in your web browser. By now

### Installing Rstudio on your own computer on windows or mac
If you have a Windows machine, the best way to install Rstudio is to download the [Desktop version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){target="_blank"}. 

If you are on a mac, one can install Rstudio through the command:
```{bash eval=F}
brew install --cask rstudio
```

## Installing Python
For those of you who will need to install python (installing python is more the exception than the norm, hence ask if unsure), it is best to install the  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual){target="_blank"}  distribution, which provides the whole python bundle and comes with a package manager.

## Install the University's VPN client 
To access the university's servers from a remote (non-university) location, we need to install a VPN client. Go to the University's [VPN page](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/departments/it/howdoi/vpn/){target="_blank"}. Download and install the VPN client for your operating system. Note that, nowadays, you typically need a 64 bit version of your programme as 32 bit computers are getting very rare.

You will only need to turn on your VPN client once you want to access servers at the university. I would turn it off otherwise, as it increases bandwidth substantially.

## Install an SSH client
To compile and run a simulation program, we need to have access to a C++ compiler that 

While this is typically easy enough (there are lots of compilers such as code blocks or visual studio).


In the olden days, I would ask students to download their own custom compiler like visual studio, gcc, code blocks and run the code through there. However, this resulted in lots of incompatibilities, so we will now run the code on our local server.
