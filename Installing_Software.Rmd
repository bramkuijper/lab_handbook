# Installing and using software to do your work
To do your research in theoretical or computational biology, you need to install software. I typically try to keep things as free and open access as possible, so that you don't have hassle with license fees. However, this is not always possible (e.g., research projects involving Mathematica or matlab).

Don't install *all* the software listed below - by now, you should have a clear idea what selection of software you need. If you have no idea, you need to get in touch.

## On a Mac? Install software using Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh){target="_blank"} is a small program that allows you to install and update multiple programs on your Mac simultaneously. Indeed, all research software that you will need on your Mac can be installed with homebrew. Using homebrew has the advantage that installation involves a single command, rather than you having to search for the correct version of the software online. Moreover, all installed packages will be updated to their latest versions by using two simple commands: `brew update`, following by `brew upgrade`.

### Installing homebrew
To install homebrew, you need to open the Terminal app (see [here](#MacTerminal) about where to find the Terminal app on your Mac). Once the terminal is open, copy the single-line install statement from the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/){target="_blank"} and paste it into the Terminal app. Then press 'Enter'. You will get a bunch of straightforward questions, after which homebrew installs itself.

### Installing your first application using homebrew
After homebrew is installed, you can use it to install other applications. You can search for software available for install through homebrew by using the website [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh). 

Let us install the [Textmate] text editor that we might need later. We do so using the [Terminal app](#MacTerminal) app, in which we type
```{bash}
brew install --cask textmate
```

## Installing R
Rather than using the [absolute bare bones version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}, I'd use Rstudio as it is substantially easier to work with. You can either use the [Rstudio server](https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk){target="_blank"} that is offered by the University of Exeter, or use a locally installed version of Rstudio. Personally, the server-based version of Rstudio is probably the easiest to use, as it has already tons of packages installed. However, if you have no uni access anymore or work with no internet access, a locally installed version of Rstudio is best.

### Using the web-based Rstudio server
You can simply access this by using your web browser. You can access the Rstudio server here:
[https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk](https://rstudio01.cles.ex.ac.uk){target="_blank"}, using your University of Exeter login. 

Once logged in, make sure to run the 4.x.x version, rather than a 3.x.x version. You can change versions on the top right of your Rstudio window within in your web browser. By now

### Using a local install of Rstudio
If you have a Windows machine, the best way to install Rstudio is to download the [Desktop version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){target="_blank"}.

## Installing Python
You will need to install the Spyder IDE and associated packages. To this end, it is best to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual){target="_blank"} which provide the whole python bundle and comes with a package manager.

## Using the Mac OS Terminal app {#MacTerminal}
On a Mac, a 'Terminal' application is available that allows you to execute UNIX shell commands on your computer. These are necessary  You can find the Terminal app in the `Applications` > `Utilities` folder. See Apple's support page [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac){target="_blank"} for more information on how to open this application.

## Installing and working with github


## Installing software to develop C++ programs
When working with the programming language C++, we will need to use the following software:

1. A better-than-normal text editor. When on Windows, install the freely available text editor [Notepad++](){target="_blank"}
